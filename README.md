# Welcome to My Rust-venture!


### What is this repo?
This repo is my learning space for the Rust programming language.  Not too much to say, 

----

### How to get this set up...
Windows PC:
- Download the 64-bit installer from [this link](https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/rustup-init.exe)
- Double check that the installation was successful by running the following commands from your terminal of choice:
  - `rustup update`
  - `cargo --version`

MacOS:
- TBD, don't have a Mac currently available or configured for development

Linux:
- TBD, I'm sure it has distro-specific details available

----

### Once things are ready...
Make sure you're in the main directory for this whole repo, `\rusting_away`.  Once you are, you can make a new project
by running the command `cargo new {my-new-project-name}`.  This will create the bare-bones framework for a new project.
Once you've gotten the code you want to run into the main file, use the command `cargo run` to run it!
